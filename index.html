<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<br>
<br>
<div class="box-purple">
    <div class="content-box"> I’m Yiota Demetriou and I am a problem-solver!
    <br>
    I can help you tackle complex technological challenges with a focus on the user and culture. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I help organisations find tech-driven solutions for Capacity Building, Immersive Media, Product Development & Ideation, Audience Engagement, and Define, Design, and Build Sustainable Digital Working Systems.

    <br>
    <br>
    These are problems that speak to different fields of expertise and so resist single, easy solutions.
    <br>
    <br>

    I am able to recognise how complex problems disclose some of our most pressing and shared needs, resulting in improvement in your teamwork and bottom line. I advocate for human-centred, simple, accessible and intuitive interactive digital experiences. 

    <br>
    <br>
    
    I am passionate about understanding users empathically, and how understandings about users’ behaviours and motives can be integrated into innovative tech solutions across industries to create cognitive solutions. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I believe that the spirit of play is essential to cross-functional collaboration, team leadership, communication, and to create meaningful and intuitive end-user experiences.By working with you, I can help address these problems, and transform them into opportunities to work more completely.

It is an intimate reading experience, about love and loss, that can ONLY only be read when its pages are warmed-up by the reader’s hands. It is a special edition with only 150 books handcrafted and sold worldwide at renowned galleries and held by some of the world’s oldest libraries in the rare books collections.</p><p>To You, is an award-winning piece that has made an impact on advancing human understanding and cognition, in the area of Science, Technology, and Art.
